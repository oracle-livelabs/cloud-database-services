# Use OCI Resource Manager to generate and deploy Terraform for Application and Database Stack


## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to generate and deploy Terraform for Application and Database stack using OCI Resource Manage.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes


### Objectives

-   After completing this lab, you should be able to generate and deploy Terraform for Application and Database stack using OCI Resource Manager.


### Prerequisites

This lab requires the completion of the following:

* Completion of **Lab1**

## Task 1: Generate Terraform baseline configuration for Database development environment using OCI Resource Manager

1. Open the navigation menu and click **Developer Services**. Under **Resource Manager**, click **Stacks**.
   
   ![Launch ORM Stacks](./images/oci-menu-orm.png " ")

2. On the **Stacks** page, select your assigned compartment.

3. Click **Create stack**.

4. On the **Create stack** page, under **Choose the origin of the Terraform configuration**, select **Existing compartment**.

5. Select your assigned **compartment** and assigned **region** containing the Exadata Database Service on Cloud@Customer Resource Model.

    ![select compartment for resource discovery](./images/orm-create-stack-from-compartment.png " ")

   This will create a stack that captures resources from the selected assigned compartment using **OCI Resource Manager (resource discovery)**

6. Filter for the specific services supported for resource discovery, select **Selected**, and then select  **database** service. 
   
7. Select your assigned **compartment** where you want to create the stack.
   
    >**Note:** For this lab, you can use **MyTFBaseline-Database** for the name of your discovered database stack.

    ![Select compartment to create stack](./images/orm-create-stack-from-compartment.png " ")

8. Click **Next** twice. No variables are listed for the Existing compartment stack origin because no Terraform configuration exists yet.

9.  In the Review panel, verify the stack configuration.

10. Click **Create**.

    ![Create your discovered database stack](./images/orm-create-stack.png " ")

11. Once the newly created stack is available, On the **Stack details** page, next to **Terraform configuration**, click **Download**.

    ![Download database stack](./images/orm-download-dbstack.png " ")

    After downloading the zip file, you can unzip the file and view the generated Terraform configuration file in your text or code editor. 

    View the *database.tf* file. 

    >**Note:** Your database's generated baseline terraform code is similar to the output below. *Resources discovered in the Baseline Terraform configuration will be presented and discussed by the speakers*

## Task 2: Deploy Gold Image Stack (Database and MyDesktop Application) using OCI Resource Manager and Terraform

1. Click **Stacks**, select your assigned **compartment**, Click **Create stack**.

    ![Deploy App and DB Stack](./images/orm-deploy-app-dbstack.png " ")

2. On the **Create stack** page, under Choose the origin of the Terraform configuration, select **My configuration**.

3. Click **.Zip file** and add the revised Terraform configuration. You can either drag the file onto the dialog's control or click **Browse** and navigate to the location of the file or folder.
   
    ![Upload zip file to deploy App and DB Stack](./images/orm-deploy-app-dbstack-from-zip.png " ")

4. Select your assigned **compartment** where you want to create the stack.

5. For Terraform version, select the version used by the Terraform configuration.

6. Click **Next**. In the Configure variables panel, review the variables listed from the Terraform configuration and change them as needed.

7. In the **Review** panel, verify the stack configuration.

8. Click **Create**

9.  On the Stack details page, click **Plan**. In the Plan panel, edit the default name for the job. For this lab, you can use **MyAppDBStackPlan** for the Plan name 
    
10. Click **Plan**. The plan job is created. The new job is listed under Jobs
    
11. On the Stack details page, click **Apply**. In the Apply panel, edit the default name for the job. For this lab, you can use **MyAppDBStackApply** for the Plan name 
    
12. Click **Apply**. The apply job is created. The new job is listed under Jobs.
