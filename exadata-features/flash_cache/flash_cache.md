# Flash Cache

## Introduction

In this practice, you are introduced to the Flash Cache capability of Exadata. There are two tasks in this lab. The first task demonstrates the query results without the Flash Cache capabilities. The second task demonstrates the advantages of using Flash Cache when executing the exact same query.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Execute a query that does not utilize Flash Cache and observe the results
* Execute a query that utilizes Flash Cache and observe the results

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes:
* Your current working directory includes all of the lab scripts
* You are connected to an Exadata database with sqlplus as the SH user

## Task 1: Query Without Flash Cache

1. Connect to the database with `sqlplus /@db`. Use the alias `sqlp`. The rest of the lab will be executed in sqlplus.

    ```text
    <copy>
    sqlp
    </copy>
    ```

2. Execute the query in the SQL script `lab_flash_cache_01.sql` and verify that the statistics are at or near zero values. If any statistics are significantly greater than zero then reconnect and retry.

    ```text
    <copy>
    @lab_flash_cache_01.sql
    </copy>
    ```

3. Flush the buffer cache to ensure that the queries must retrieve the required data from the storage cells.

    ```text
    <copy>
    EXECUTE sys.flush_buffer_cache;
    </copy>
    ```

4. Execute the SQL script `lab_flash_cache_02.sql`. The PL/SQL block performs 500 record lookups spread across a reasonably large table. The workload is representative of the scattered record access normally associated with an OLTP application. Note that the workload may take a few minutes to complete.

    ```text
    <copy>
    @lab_flash_cache_02.sql
    </copy>
    ```

5. Repeat the statistics query in the SQL script `lab_flash_cache_01.sql`. Note the high number of IO requests (`physical read total IO requests`) relative to the low number of optimized requests (`physical read requests optimized` and `cell flash cache read hits`). This indicates that the queries were mostly satisfied by using physical disk reads and is indicative of a recently emptied cache.

    ```text
    <copy>
    @lab_flash_cache_01.sql
    </copy>
    ```

    > Note: If `cell flash cache read hits` is not showing near zero, run the `lab_flash_cache_cleanup.sql` script to reset the table used for this practice and start the practice over again.

## Task 2: Query With Flash Cache

1. Disconnect and reconnect your session. Repeat the statistics query using the SQL script `lab_flash_cache_01.sql` and verify that the statistics are again at or near zero values. If any statistics are significantly greater than zero then reconnect again and retry.

    ```text
    <copy>
    @lab_flash_cache_01.sql
    </copy>
    ```

2. Again, flush the buffer cache to ensure that the queries in the next step must retrieve the required data from the Exadata cells.

    ```text
    <copy>
    EXECUTE sys.flush_buffer_cache;
    </copy>
    ```

3. Re-execute the query in the SQL script `lab_flash_cache_02.sql`.

    ```text
    <copy>
    @lab_flash_cache_02.sql
    </copy>
    ```

4. Repeat the statistics query using the SQL script `lab_flash_cache_01.sql`. Compare the values for `cell flash cache read hits` and `physical read total IO requests`. They should be closer together, indicating that most of the I/Os were satisfied by Exadata Smart Flash Cache.

    ```text
    <copy>
    @lab_flash_cache_01.sql
    </copy>
    ```

    > Note: If `cell flash cache read hits` is showing zero, you may be running this lab on a system with Extreme Flash storage cells. Since the flash cache on EF systems prior to X10M is on the storage disks and is not used for standard queries, `cell flash cache read hits` shows zero.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
