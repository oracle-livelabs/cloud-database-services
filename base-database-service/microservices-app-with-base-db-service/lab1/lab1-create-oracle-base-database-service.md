### Objectives

-   Create Oracle Base Database Service Instance.

### Prerequisites

This lab requires completion of the following:

* Setting Up Your Tenancy - After Oracle creates your tenancy in OCI, an administrator at your company will need to perform some setup tasks and establish an organization plan for your cloud resources and users.




## Task 1: Create Oracle Base Database Service Instance.

1.  **Login** into the **OCI Console** and Select **Oracle Database**

    ![OCI Console Navigate to Oracle Database](./images/navigate.oracledatabase.png" ")

2.	**Navigate** to the **database** service that you deployed by selecting **Oracle Base Database**

    ![Navigate to Base Database](./images/navigate.basedb.png" ")

3.	Click the **“Create DB System”** button to proceed.

    ![Create DB System](./images/create.db.png" ")

    * This will bring up the Create DB System Dialog screen

**Follow the steps to fill in the information for the DB System.**

4.	Validate that the **Compartment** shown is where you want your DB System to be created.

    ![Create DB System](./images/validate.compartment.png" ")

5.	Enter a **display name** for your DB system.

6.	Select the **Availability Domain (AD)** in which the DB system will resides ensuring to select a region that best meets your business needs and    
    satisfies any data location restrictions.

7.	Select **Virtual Machine** for the **Shape Type** option to be used for launching the DB system.
    * The shape type selected determines the list of available shapes to select from in the next step.

8.	Click on **Change Shapes**
    * For the Shapes, you can choose between **AMD or Intel** Processors.

    ![Change Shape](./images/change.shape.png" ")

9.	Select **AMD for the Processor** and use the slider bar in the **Configure OCPU section** to Configure the desired OCPU.  

    ![Select Shape](./images/select.shape.png" ")

10.	Click on the **Select Shape button** to complete the shape selection process


**Now let’s Choose the type of storage management software that we will use with our database VM.**
11.	Choose between **Oracle Grid Infrastructure** or **Logical Volume Manager** for the Storage Management Software

    ![Change Storage](./images/change.storage.png" ")

    * 2 things to note is that Oracle Grid Infrastructure is recommended for production workloads and that Logical Volume Manager is only available for single-node VM systems

    ![Select Storage](./images/select.storage.png" ")


**Next, we will configure the storage performance**
12.	Choose between **Balanced & Higher Performance** Storage Volumes

    * For the **Available Data Storage**, Select the amount of Block storage that you want allocated to the VM DN System.
    * The **Recovery Area Storage** field displays the amount of storage that will be available for recovery log data (RECO data) based on the amount of storage select ed for the DATA space.
    * You can change the amount of Recovery area storage independently after provisioning

    ![Select Storage performance](./images/select.storage.perf.png" ")

13.	Click on the **save changes** button to continue configuring the DB system

14.	Next, we will Select the **Total number of VM Nodes** that will be in our **DB System** and the **Oracle Database Software Edition** that will be supported by the DB system

    ![Configure Node](./images/configure.node.png" ")

    ![Select Database Edition](./images/db.edition.png" ")

15.	In the **Add SSH Keys section** of the page we will add our SSH public key to enable access to the VM DB System via SSH.

    * To Add the **SSH Public Key** portion of the key pair, choose from one of the provided 3 options.

    ![Add SSH Keys](./images/add.ssh.keys.png" ")

16.	Select the **License Type** that we want to use for the Virtual Machine DB system.

    * The options are **License included** or **Bring Your Own License (BYOL).**

    ![Select License Type](./images/license.type.png" ")

17.	**In the Network Information section**:

    a)	For the **VCN** use the pull-down menu to **select the VCN** in which you want to launch the VM DB system.

    b)	For the **CLIENT SUBNET**

    ![Select VCN](./images/select.vcn.png" ")

    c)	The **Use Network Security groups box** is optional and unchecked by default

    d)	For the HOSTNAME PREFIX, enter the desired value.

    * The Hostname Prefix forms the first portion of the DB systems Host Name and will be used as part of the Fully Qualified Domain Name
    * For RAC systems, the Database service automatically appends a node number after the hostname prefix.

    e)	The **HOST Domain Name**, note how the Subnet DNS and VCN labels are used to auto generate the **HOST DOMAIN NAME**.

    f)	The **Host and domain URL** is auto generated and combines the hostname prefix and host domain name to display the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the database.

    ![Hostname Prefix](./images/hostname.prefix.png" ")

18.	If you click on the **Advanced Option Link**, you will see the ability to optionally select a **Fault domain**, **Time Zone**, or **set Tags** for the DB System.

19.	Click on **Next** to proceed with entering the **details for the initial database**

    a)	For the **Database Name** field enter the **desired database name**  

    b)	For the **Database Unique Name Suffix** enter **the desired value**

    * Note that the Database Unique Name is the combination of the DB Name and the DB Unique Name Suffix

    ![Database Name](./images/db.name.png" ")

20.	**Let’s explore the available database images** by clicking on the **Change Database Image Button**

    ![Change DB Image](./images/change.db.image.png" ")

    * You are able to choose between **Oracle Database Software Images** and **Custom Database Software Images**

    ![Choose Database Software Image](./images/db.sw.image.png" ")

21.	Click on the Select Button to proceed with configuring the database details

    ![PDB Name](./images/pdb.name.png" ")

    b) Next enter the **Administrator Credentials**

    c) Ensure that the **Use Administrator password for the TDE wallet** box is checked if you want to **Use of Oracle Managed Keys**

    d) For the **Database Workload Type** you can choose between **Transaction Processing** and **Data Warehouse**

      * Choose the type that best aligns with your application

    ![Select Database Workload Type](./images/db.workload.png" ")

    e) **Enable Automatic  Backups** is selected by default

    ![Enable Automatic Backups](./images/enable.automatic.bkup.png" ")

      *	You can select the **backup retention period**

    ![Backup retention period](./images/retention.period.png" ")

      *	Specify the **Backup Scheduling window**

    ![Backup Scheduling Window](./images/bkup.schedule.png" ")

      *	Uncheck the **Enable Automatic Backups** box if you want to configure it after the database is provisioned


22.	If you click on the **Advanced Options** link, you will find 3 tabs with options to fine tune the planned database configuration

    ![Advanced Options](./images/advanced.options.png" ")

    a)	The **Management Tab** allows you to change the **Database Character Set** and the **National Character Set**
