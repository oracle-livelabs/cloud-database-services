# Get started - Connect to Oracle Cloud Tenancy


## **Introduction**

Oracle Cloud is the industry's broadest and most integrated cloud provider, with deployment options ranging from the public cloud to your data center. Oracle Cloud offers best-in-class services across Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Database as a Service (DBaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

**Estimated Time:** ***5 minutes***

<u>**Types of Cloud Accounts that can be used for this workshop:**</u>

   * ***Oracle Cloud Paid Account***: When your tenancy is provisioned, Oracle sends an email to the default administrator at your company with the sign-in credentials and URL. This administrator can then create a user for each person who needs access to the Oracle Cloud. Check your email or contact your administrator for your credentials and account name.

   * ***Oracle provided Cloud Workshop Account***: This type of environment can be obtained by engaging with your Sales Engineer to coordinate obtaining approval to obtain an Event Code which will provide temporary access to an Oracle provided environment.
