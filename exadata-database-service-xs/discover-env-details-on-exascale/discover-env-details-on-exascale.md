# Discover Environment Details using OCI Console


## Introduction

  *(To enable you to have the most hands-on experince within this 90 minute workshop, we have pre-provisioned a VM Cluster & Container Database using the Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure - Informational Instructions for navigating the Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure environment will be presented by the speakers)*
  
  This lab walks you through the steps to discover how to navigate to the Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure and discover the environment details for the Exadata VM Cluster, Container Database, Pluggable Database, and the Exascale Storage Vault using the OCI Console.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.
