### Objectives

-   After completing this lab, you should be able to create an Exadata VM cluster and an Oracle Database Home on the Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure using the OCI Console.


### Prerequisites

This lab requires completion of the following:

* Successful Login to a Tenancy with a service limit assigned for the **Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure**

## Task 1: Create an Exadata VM Cluster Resource with Exadata on Exascale Cloud Infrastructure

1. Open the navigation menu. Under **Oracle Database**, click **Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure**.

  ![Navigate to Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure](./images/console-to-exadb-xs.png" ")

2. In the left rail, **VM Clusters** is selected by default. Under **List Scope**, Select your assigned standby compartment named ***MyStandbyCompartmentXX***. 
   
  ![Select Compartment where Standby Exadata VM Cluster will reside Image](./images/select-standby-compartment.png" ")

3. Click **Create VM Cluster** button 
    
    This causes the **Create VM Cluster** page to be displayed.  

4. **Provide the basic information to configure the Exadata VM cluster**.
    * **For Compartment:** Ensure that the compartment that you want the VM Cluster to be created in is displayed. It should display ***your assigned compartment***.

    * **For Display Name:** Enter ***MyStandbyVMClusterXX*** 

    * **For Cluster Name:** Enter ***MyClusterXX*** 

    * **For Availability Domain:** Select the availability domain from the displayed options available. 

 ![Provide Basic Standby VM Cluster Info Image](./images/provide-basic-standby-vm-cluster-info-exascale.png" ")

5. **To Configure the VM cluster, provide the following information:** 
    * **For number of VMs in the cluster:** ***Enter 2***
    * **For ECPUs enabled per VM:** ***Enter 8*** 

      <u>**Size the VM file system storage**</u>: 
    * **For system storage capacity per VM (GB):** ***Enter 280***

      **Note:**  The VM Filesystems storage includes /u02 capacity, where your Database Homes will go, along with all of the other VM filesystems (/, /boot, /tmp, /var, /var/log, /var/log/audit, /home, swap, kdump, /u01, grid, /u02). Any extra capacity selected beyond system minimums will go into /u02. 

  ![Configure VM Cluster](./images/configure-standby-vm-cluster-exascale.png" ")

6. **Enter Configuration Details for Exascale Database Storage Vault:** 
    * Select ***Create new vault***. 

    * For the **Exascale Vault name:** enter ***MyStandbyStorageVaultXX*** . 
    * For the **Storage Capacity for Databases (GB):** ***enter 300***. 

    > **Note:** The minimum size configuration for an Exascale Database Storage Vault is 300 GB. 50 GB of the space that you allocate in your Vault is reserved for an internal ACFS file system. <br>This ACFS file system resides within your Exascale Database Storage Vault, but is reserved for system use. <br>Thus, if you provisioned the minimum of 300 GB in your Exascale Database Storage Vault, then 250 GB of that 300 GB capacity will be available storage for your databases.

7. **Select the Oracle Grid Infrastructure version and add SSH key:** 
    * **Grid Infrastructure Release and Version fields:** display the Oracle Grid Infrastructure versions available for deployment in the VM cluster. <br/>
    ***Accept the default values for the 23ai release***.

  ![Select Grid Infrastructure version Image](./images/select-grid-infra-version.png" ")

8. **Add your SSH Key for future access to your VMs**. <u>Choose from:</u>

      * **Generate SSH key pair**(Default option) ***Select this option to generate an SSH keypair for this lab.*** <br>Then in the dialog below click ***Save private key*** to download the key, and then click ***Save public key*** to download the key. 
      * **Upload SSH key files**: Select this option to browse or drag and drop .pub files. 
      * **Paste SSH keys:** Select this option to paste in individual public keys.

  ![Add SSH Key Image](./images/add-ssh-key.png" ")
 

9. **To Configure the network settings, Select VCN and select Client and Backup subnet** 
    * **For the Virtual Cloud Network (VCN):** Click Change Compartment and select compartment named ***MyDemo***.  <br/>
    Then select the Virtual Cloud Network named ***MyDemoVCN***.
    
    * **For the Client subnet:** Select the client subnet in the **assigned standby compartment** named ***MyClient-PrivateSubnetBXX***. <br/>
    
    * **For the Backup Subnet:** Click Change Compartment and select compartment named ***MyDemo***.  <br/>
    Then select the Backup Subnet named ***MyBackup-PrivateSubnet***.
    
    * **For the Hostname Prefix:** Enter ***StandbyHost***

  ![Configure Standby VM Network Settings Image](./images/configure-standby-vm-network-settings.png" ")

10. **Select license type & choose opt-in choices for Diagnostic & Collections options.**
    * **Choose a license type:** The type of license that you want to use for the VM cluster. Your choice affects metering for billing. ***Select the Bring Your Own License (BYOL) option.*** 

  ![Choose BYOL for VM Cluster License Type Image](./images/choose-byol-license-type.png" ")

11. **Select Diagnostic and Collections Options**
In the Edit Diagnostics Collection Settings dialog, you can enable or disable any of the Diagnostics Collections options. By enabling diagnostics collection and notifications, Oracle Cloud Operations and you will be able to identify, investigate, track, and resolve guest VM issues quickly and effectively. ***Accept the default values***.
    * **Enable Diagnostics Events:** Allows Oracle to collect and publish critical, warning, error, and information events to me. For more information, see Overview of Database Service Events
    * **Enable Health Monitoring:** Allows Oracle to collect health metrics/events such as Oracle Database up/down, disk space usage, and so on, and share them with Oracle Cloud operations. You will also receive notification of some events. 
    * **Enable Incident logs and trace collection:** Allows Oracle to collect incident logs and traces to enable fault diagnosis and issue resolution. 
 
  ![Choose Diagnostic & Collections options](./images/choose-diagnostic-and-collections-options.png" ")

12. Click **Create VM Cluster** to proceed with provisioning. 
    * The provisioning automation will display the Vault creation progress screen
    * Next, you will see the **VM Cluster Details** page displayed initially with a state of ***PROVISIONING*** and then a state of ***AVAILABLE*** once the process completes.

## Task 2: Create an Oracle Database Home using OCI Console

1. On the **VM Cluster Details page** under **Resources** Click on ***Database Homes*** and then click on the ***Create Database Home** button.

  ![Select Create Database Home button Image](./images/dbhome-create-for-standby-vmc.png " ")

2. On the **Create Database Home page**, enter ***MyDemo23aiDBhome02*** and validate that the **Database image** selected is ***Oracle Database 23ai***.

  ![Name VMC Standby DBhome and Select Version Image](./images/dbhome-name-and-select-version-for-standby-vmc.png " ")

3. Click on the ***Create*** button to proceed with creating the Database Home.

  * The provisioning automation will display the **Database Home Details** page with a state of ***PROVISIONING*** and then a state of ***AVAILABLE*** once the process completes.
