# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this hands-on class, you’ll deploy and configure Oracle databases using the Exadata Database Service in our lab environment, leveraging the user interface web console and Terraform. 
 
In one of the most real-world classes you’ll ever attend, you’ll learn the latest techniques designed to simplify operational tasks and automate standards-based deployments of the database for your applications. You will use cloud automation functions to create database environments leveraging VM Cluster Node Subsetting consolidation feature.  . You’ll learn how the Exadata platform embraces cloud economics to control costs with the ability to scale CPUs up and down and to scale out compute and storage nodes. 
 
To meet your desired SLA levels, you’ll configure Maximum Availability constructs for your databases by enabling high availability and disaster recovery with Data Guard and Active Data Guard and cloud-based automatic backup and recovery. 

Don’t miss your chance to learn how to use cloud automation functions to standardize your database cloud environments, all while realizing the performance and scale of the Oracle Database on the Exadata Cloud Platform that is available to all types of workloads.

Estimated Workshop Time: 160 minutes

**What is an Oracle Exadata Database Service?**

Oracle Exadata Database Service is a high-performance co-managed Oracle Cloud Database service that allows organizations to run databases with extreme performance, availability, and security cost-effectively. Databases run faster and with fewer resources on scale-out Exadata infrastructure that includes unique optimizations for transaction processing, analytics, and mixed workloads. Online scaling of computing resources enables customers to quickly adjust consumption to match workload demands without interrupting operations, while efficient database consolidation further lowers total costs. Full compatibility with on-premises Oracle Database and Exadata environments makes it easy for customers to migrate workloads to the cloud.

Exadata Database Service allows you to leverage the power of Exadata in the cloud. 
Exadata Database Service’s scale-out architecture allows customers to provision more compute and storage independently, to be able to
easily right-size their service to meet their growing workload demand. 
Exadata Database Service offer RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) networking for high bandwidth and low latency, Exadata RDMA Memory (XRMEM) Cache, and intelligent Exadata software.

Exadata Database Service reduces downtime and simplifies operational management with zero downtime maintenance, online scaling, and one-click provisioning of Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC) and Oracle Active Data Guard using built-in cloud automation. Exadata Database Service has built-in Oracle Maximum Availability Architecture (Oracle MAA) best practices that help it to increase database availability out of the box.



**What is an Oracle Exadata Database Service on Cloud@Customer?**

Oracle Exadata Database Service on Cloud@Customer enables you to apply the combined power of Oracle Exadata and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure inside your own data center. You have full access to the features and capabilities of Oracle Database along with the intelligent performance and scalability of Oracle Exadata, but with Oracle owning and managing the Exadata infrastructure. You can use the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console and APIs to manage Oracle Exadata Database Service on Cloud@Customer just as with any other cloud resource, while maintaining absolute sovereignty over your data.

Oracle Exadata Database Service on Cloud@Customer is the simplest way to move an organization’s business-critical Oracle Database workloads to the cloud. It simultaneously runs Oracle Exadata Database Service and the fully managed Oracle Autonomous Database Service inside customers’ data centers and behind their firewalls to help meet strict data residency and security requirements.

Oracle Exadata Database Service on Cloud@Customer provides the same user experience as Exadata Database Service on Dedicated Infrastructure with Oracle-owning and managing the infrastructure that is located in your data center.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**
